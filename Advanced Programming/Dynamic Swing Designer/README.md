# Dynamic Swing Designer
Created an MVC application to assist the user in building a Swing graphical user interface  
The user specifies the class name of the Swing component and by simple-left-clicking he adds it on the canvas  
Also, he can enter a default text or a path to a JAR where a custom component is, in order to be loaded  
The canvas can be saved and loaded in XML format  
By simple-left-clicking a component, a table with its properties appears, some of them being editable  
Use the following command to open the designer after creating the JAR:  
```
java -jar DynamicSwingDesigner-1.0.jar
```
