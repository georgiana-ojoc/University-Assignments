# Graph Editor (Maven Project)
Created an MVC application with graphical user interface for creating graphs using Swing  
The user can change node shapes (circle, rounded square or star) and graph colors  
By simple-left-clicking he can put a node on the canvas and delete it by double-left-clicking on it  
By simple-right-clicking he can draw an edge between two nodes and delete it by double-right-clicking on or near it  
He can also save his drawing or load an existent graph from the external memory  
Implemented the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout algorithm that can be applied on the drawn graphs  
Use the following command to open the editor after creating the JAR:  
```
java -jar GraphEditor-1.0.jar
```
