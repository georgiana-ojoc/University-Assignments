# Gomoku REST API (using Spring Boot and MySQL)  
Implemented a REST API that manages the game rooms and the players of Gomoku.  
Created a RoomController and a PlayerController that used HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.  
Integrated the services into the Gomoku server, so that players register and login, create and join rooms using HTTP requests.  
Secured the services using JSON Web Tokens and documented them using Swagger.  
Use the following command to open the server after creating the JAR:  
```
java -jar REST-API-1.0.jar
```
