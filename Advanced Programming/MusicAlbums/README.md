# Music Albums (Maven Project with MySQL Database)
Implemented an application that handles a database that stores artists, albums and charts  
Used design patterns like Singleton for database and Data Access Object for data controllers  
Generated random data with JavaFaker  
Computed the ranking of artists, considering their positions in charts  
Created HTML reports with FreeMarker  
Used HikariConnectionPool and ThreadPoolExecutor to create 5000 threads that access the database concurrently  
Analyzed the behaviour of the application in VisualVM  
Use the following command to open the editor after creating the JAR:  
```
java -jar MusicAlbums-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
