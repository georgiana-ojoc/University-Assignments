# Internationalization and Localization
Created an application that explores the available locales included in the standard JDK  
The shell includes the following commands:  
 - display - display all available locales  
 - set <language tag> - set application current locale  
 - info <language tag> - display locale information (country, language, currency, week days, months, today)  
 - flag <country ISO> - open country flag image in Google Chrome (invoked [DataFlex Web Service for Country information](http://www.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso) REST Web Service)  
 - exit - close shell  
Use the following command to open the shell after creating the JAR:  
```
java -jar InternationalizationLocalization-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
